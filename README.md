ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TonIann7!

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in sports in general, especially football, and I have a deep fascination with computer science.

ğŸŒ± Currently, I am a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Naples Parthenope.

ğŸ’¼ My future ambitions involve advancing my career in computer science, with a particular focus on artificial intelligence.

âš¡ Fun fact:
Mom asked me to buy a liter of milk and, if available, six eggs. 
I returned with six liters of milk, and she asked me in surprise, "Why did you buy six liters of milk?" 
And I replied, "Because they had eggs!"
